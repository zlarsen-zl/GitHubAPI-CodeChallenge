## GitHub API Code Challenge

The normal github api has a rate call of 60 calls per hour
I created enviromental variables with my own personal github username and a generated Personal Token to 
include in my api calls so that I increased my api rate call limit.

You will have to replace those variables with your own username/token if cloning down this application.
